# Big Bill
## A card game

Note: This is not my game, and I am not sure who invented it. I played the game and decided to recreate it online so my friends and I can play anywhere, with or without cards/dice. I am not sure of the real name of this game, and name "Big Bill" is something my friends and I came up with, explained later.

Big Bill is a card game for 2 or more players. The concept of the game is simple. Cards from Ace to Queen are laid face up, representing the numbers 1 through 12. One at a time, each player rolls two dice. Using the number the dice add up to, the player must either flip the card corresponding to that number, or any two cards which add together to sum the rolled number.

For example, if a player rolled a 2 and 5, they could flip one of the following options:
-the Seven
-the Ace and the Six
-the Two and the Five
-the Three and the Four

The player then rolls the dice again, flipping one or two cards each time until they can't flip anymore. Say for example all cards have been flipped over except the Six, Seven, and Eight. If a player then rolls a 4 and a 5, they would be out: 4+5=9, and they have already flipped the 9 and all possible numbers which add to 9.

Once the player cannot roll anymore, they add up the cards leftover and that is their score. The lowest score wins. 

The name "Big Bill" comes from the fact we usually play this game at a bar. The Loser (with the highest score) must buy themself a shot and a shot for whoever the Winner choses. So if you lose a few games, you will most likely end up with a big bill at the end of the night.
